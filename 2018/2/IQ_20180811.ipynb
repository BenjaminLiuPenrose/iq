    "### 1.2 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook with pages numbered 1 through 12. Each page is an element of the array 'notebook'. You would retrieve information from a page by referring to its number or subscript, i.e., notebook(4) would refer to page 4 of the array notebook.\n",

    "2. A few languages (C, C++) will not check the bounds and return or set some arbitrary value when an element outside the valid range is accessed.\n",
    "3. Scripting languages often automatically expand the array when data is written to an index which was not valid until then."
